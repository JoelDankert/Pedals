# Pedals Readme
*lacking documentation for this project (personal)*

A simple driver and hardware script to connect a custom-built set of pedals, via a Raspberry Pi and a multiplexer, together with a steering wheel on a ESP32, to your computer. The system smoothes and improves input and then emulates a joystick device, making it compatible with driving simulators such as BeamNG.drive.
